# Apache Spark Data Exploration Notes

This repo contains notes from a class I took on Pluralsight to learn Apache Spark

Spark is an engine that helps us explore data and develop sophisticated machine learning models. Spark abstracts the user away from all the messiness of working with large data sets. This class is all about using Spark and Resilient Distributed Data Sets to process complicated data.

The major topics that will be covered include:

- Cleaning Unstructured Data
- Summarizing Data Along Dimentions
- Modeling Relationships To Build Co-Occurance Networks
