# Transforming & Cleaning Unstructured Data

The goal of this lesson was to become familiar with operations that you can use in Spark to convert data from a raw unstructured form to a structured form that you can actually analyze. We will learn how to transform data using functional constructs like filter, map, and reduce. We'll learn to identify and remove anomalies and missing values.
